1.20
-------
*
added option to disable PTF changing/randomizing

*
added randomizing/changing of the gameboot

*
added randomizing/changing of custom XMB waves (system_plugin_bg.rco)

*
added randomizing/changing of XMB font

*
added file extension filter for scanning directories
i.e. it will now only fetch .BMP for wall-/wavepapers, .PTF for themes
and so forth....


1.14
-------
*
Fixed some lockups during start

*
Fixed another conflict with wavepapers in "Once per day" mode

*
added PTF changing/randomizing :D

*
Added two PC based (Windows) tools for making propper 01-12.bmp replacements (background behind XMB waves) and perfect 480x272x24 PSP wallpapers you can then use with the Wallpaper-Changer.
Both tools take various image formats in any possible resolution as source images and should make most converting tasks very easy (two mouseclicks, and you're set :))


1.10
-------
*
Added capability of changing/randomizing the background *BEHIND* the XMB wave lines
(WITHOUT touching the flash0:! So, perfectly save ;))
Read the notes about this in the readme when having trouble with it!

*
Wallpapers are now finally copied BEFORE the XMB loads, so you see the change imediately, not at the next reboot

*
Major internal changes (making the plugin pure kernel mode and dealing with the consequences), the usual bug hunting and some cleaning up of the code.
