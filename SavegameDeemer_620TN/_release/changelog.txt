v1.11
=======
*
fixed "not working on 6.20-TN"


----------------------------------------


v1.10
=======
* 
Did some mayor internal changes due to huge compatibility issues when actually running/using the plugin.
Should be way more stable now, hopefully running on 100% (or at least 99.9% ;) ) of the games.
Also it's only one .PRX now, not splitted in two anymore, since the main .PRX is now a native kernel mode one.

*
The usual minor bug fixes

*
Added a new feature to patch/overwrite the SFO params/info on save (see readme)


----------------------------------------


v1.00

Initial Release
